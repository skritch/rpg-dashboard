 Oh, my! Yes?
 You foreigners are wandering too far in districts you don't belong to.
 What's your business?
 Oh, I'm so sorry.
 I, I was just so amazed by the architecture here.
 I wanted to see the beautiful sculpture.
 We definitely are visitors here, sir.
 No one has explained, I guess, the rules to your city.
 We were just taking in the fantastic architecture and history of Kraghammer.
 LAURA. We were told there was a beautiful sculpture down the street of the ruler of Kraghammer?
 MATT. Make a persuasion roll.
 TRAVIS. Oh, Jesus.
 Oh, God. Either of you, whichever you prefer.
 If only I was there.
 21.
 That's good.
 All right, all right.
 Wow, pretty decent.
 The guards come up to each other,
 and the one that was talking to you,
 you can see now, as you come a little closer
 into the light, kind of a frazzled black beard
 that's come to a very, very tight braid
 that goes down to his belly button,
 all wearing the same basic chest plate,
 long black velvet cloak behind,
 carrying some sort of heavy war hammer.
